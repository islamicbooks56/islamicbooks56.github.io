    "Description": "The secret behind the sincere piety approved by God is to practice the tenets of the Qur’an without fail. Every Muslim should check themselves at any moment to identify their shortcomings and remedy these points as soon as possible in order to better practice the Qur’an. In this fleeting world where we are but momentary guests, we should strive to become sincerely pious believers, who practice religion to the best of our ability in full compliance with God’s wishes, so as to imbue our souls with a quality befitting of paradise and to be worthy of God’s love. \n   This book collects the verses of the Qur’an under various headings to show and remind us how we can put the verses into practice in our daily lives as a prayer to increase our effort to become more pious. In this way, it will be easier to find an answer to the question “How would God want us to act in this situation?” and implement it in any incident we encounter throughout the day. Humankind is prone to forgetfulness, absent-mindedness and being absorbed in details, thus losing track of what is essential. May God render this book a means to remind us and urge us to remind others what is essential lest we forget, and to make us spend every minute seeking the most of God’s approval.",

    "Description": "Love is the main purpose of God’s creation of the universe. God is most loving, most loved, and is pleased with love. True love is a special feeling God has created as a blessing for those who have faith. The believers who love God with all their life and soul, who have a sincere fear of God, who discern God's magnificent artistry and appreciate it as due, and those who take God as their Guardian, Helper and Protector are the ones who most profoundly experience the love God grants them in return for their true faith.\n   This book is comprised of the words of love in the Gospel that are in agreement with the Qur'an. Those parts from the Gospel which explain the essence of true love is genuine guidance for all believers. \nGod reveals in the Qur'an that Muslims should believe in all the Books of God. \nThose who have faith in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, and are certain about the Hereafter. (Surat al-Baqara, 4) \n   Some parts of the Gospel have been distorted and this detracted from its true meaning. The guide that shows which parts of the Gospel is true to its origin and which have been contorted is the Qur’an, the final Holy Book sent by God. The Qur'an confirms the true parts of the Torah and the Gospel and abolishes the altered parts. In this respect, the Qur’an is a judge for those who have faith.",

Our Prophet (May Allah bless him and grant him peace) fulfilled the great responsibility he was given in the best way possible, summoned people to Allah’s path and became the one who guided all believers to Allah’s path. As is known, All-Mighty Allah supported our Prophet (May Allah bless him and grant him peace) with many miracles from His Sight. Our purpose in this book is to remind people of some of the miracles Allah granted to our blessed Prophet (May Allah bless him and grant him peace) He made exemplary to all people with his superior morality, profound faith and all his manners and words. By Allah’s leave, throughout his life, our Prophet (May Allah bless him and grant him peace) showed many miracles to people. Some of these miracles were witnessed only by his followers while some others by a great majority of unbelievers. Some of the miracles of our Prophet (May Allah bless him and grant him peace) are conveyed in the Qur’an while some others in our Prophet’s (May Allah bless him and grant him peace) sayings and in various explanations of Islamic scholars. Our purpose is to show our blessed Prophet’s (May Allah bless him and grant him peace) miraculous aspects to people and to summon them to make the Qur’an and our Prophet’s (May Allah bless him and grant him peace) Sunnah a guide to themselves.",

    "Type": "audio",
    "Language": "english",
    "Description": "Most people know that idolatry is a grave sin, but never think that it could have anything to do with them. They imagine that idolaters, defined as those who ascribe equals to Allah, are merely people who worship totems carved out of stone or wood, like the primitive pre-Islamic Arab pagans who worshipped idols in the Ka`bah (The Sacred House). However, idolatry is far more subtle and is actually widespread in many societies today. \nIn reality, idolatry comprises everything that people set up as a goal that does not involve seeking Allah’s approval, in who or which they place their hopes or desire for approval, or every entity regarded as possessing true power and control other than Allah. \nGiven the subtlety of this definition, idolatry needs to be considered as something that may be very close at hand. Ascribing equals to Allah is a most dangerous sin, one that cannot be forgiven and therefore will lead people to Hell. Thus, those who fear and respect Allah and hope for His Paradise must be on their guard against this threat. But people cannot do this if they do not know what idolatry is and what things fall under its scope. \nThis book has been written to illustrate how idolatry, as set out in the Qur’an, exists in contemporary society. We hope that it will achieve this aim, help people renounce all of their idols, and turn sincerely to and serve only Almighty Allah, the true Creator of all things.",

    "Language": "english",
    "Description": "Each prophet possesses virtues that are praised in the Qur'an. Therefore, believers must carefully study every detail of these Qur'anic accounts so that they can take these men's lives, moral virtues, and deep devotion to Allah as models for themselves. Each prophet was sent to his own tribe, experienced different situations, and used various methods to explain Allah's existence. For that reason, the natures of the prophets' tribes, and their reactions to the prophets, as well as the difficulties experienced by those who became believers and the prophets themselves, provide us with important information about how we can please Allah. \n     This book introduces the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him), who is praised in the Qur'an in these terms: \"You have an excellent example in Abraham and those with him\" (Surat al-Mumtahana: 4)  so that they can serve as role models for our own lives. Since every piece of information about the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) contains considerable wisdom, we shall examine their lives closely in this book so that we can follow his example.",

They attribute the complexity and\nbeauty exhibited in all their magnificence at every point in the universe to chance, simply\nto deny the existence of Allah. They have no qualms about maintaining that\nunconsciousness and random events gave rise to consciousness, reason, order,\nunderstanding and beauty. This book reveals those matters that they heedlessly ignore, or\nwhich they claim that the theory of evolution fully explains but without ever entering into\nthe details. This book shows how their theory is actually unproven, despairing and in a\nhelpless position in all areas.",

Wisdom, patience, loyalty, unbelief and the favours of Allah are some of these concepts, to name a few. \n    The majority of the aforementioned concepts are, however, used with quite different connotations in the course of our daily lives. Should those somewhat conversant with the Qur’an establish their Qur’anic standpoint on the basis of these connotations, they will surely come to have a poor grasp of its content.",

Social ills of this kind that individuals and societies are exposed to have been around for hundreds of years.\nSo have people to date striven against these evils or made efforts to be free of them? Of course, people have been subjected to these social maladies throughout history and have struggled against them, but since they have always looked for solutions in the wrong places, they have never achieved success.\nThere is no doubt that the only solution to these social ills is for people to live by “true religious values.” So long as they do not live by true religious values, people will be condemned to suffer these problems, because this is the “nightmare of disbelief.”\nThis book describes how “the nightmare of disbelief,” in other words evils, despair and social insecurity, can be prevented so long as people live by the model of “moral values” revealed in the true faith sent down by Allah to man, how social problems can be erased, what spiritual benefits this will bring and how living by religious moral values is the only way of being freed from these scourges.",
